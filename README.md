Extensible MIDI synthesizer editor, initially devised for the Waldorf Blofeld.

So far, I'm still developing on the dev/ branch, so there's only the README.md
file on master so far. The dev/ branch is usually stable, but there are
a couple of things that are not completely implemented yet; when there is
some form of feature completeness I'll merge it to master.

More to come...
