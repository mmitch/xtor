xtor (formerly midiedit)
=========================

Extensible MIDI synthesizer editor, initially devised for the Waldorf Blofeld.

Development takes place on the dev/ branch, which is merged to master when
releases are made. The dev/ branch is usually stable, but may be rebased
(since the last merge-to-master point) at any time.

There is now a release branch which is intended for binary distribution.
Until version 1.3, the only binary branch (squeeze-32) was built on a 32-bit
Debian Squeeze system. From version 1.4, the binary release is intended for
a 64-bit Debian Wheezy system.

See the README file for user and developer documentation, also including
a Quick Start guide for impatient users.

Please note that contrary to older entries in the release notes, Linux now
contains support for the Novation Nocturn, so no separate application is needed
to use it with xtor.
