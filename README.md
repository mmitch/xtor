midiedit
========

Extensible MIDI synthesizer editor, initially devised for the Waldorf Blofeld.

Development takes place on the dev/ branch, which is merged to master when
releases are made. The dev/ branch is usually stable, but may be rebased
(since the last merge-to-master point) at any time.

See the README file for user and developer documentation, also including
a Quick Start guide for impatient users.
