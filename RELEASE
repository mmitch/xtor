Release notes for midiedit 1.3

- Restructured Sound page so that oscillator level/balance is in the osc
  boxes, rather than in separate mixer boxes, so the controls line up
  with the oscillators.
- Fix get buffer when selecting part number with keys. Need to press 
  ENTER in order to cause the part to be fetched though.
- Minor cosmetic cleanups in the code.

- Fixed osc Limit WT and Osc Sync: parameter numbers were mixed up.
- Fixed step range and increment for Arp Tempo parameter.
- Fixed inverted ranges scrolling wrong way.
