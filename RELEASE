Release notes for xtor 1.5

- Fixed a long-time annoying bug in that the device number is blank at
  startup even though the value is actually 0.
- Found and fixed another bug whereas the device number was actually not
  used for parameter updates, always being set to 0 in that case, only for
  bulk transfers.
- Got a report that -ansi causes build failures because there are system header
  files that apparently are not ANSI compatible. -std=c99 works better, but
  has warnings. So fixed the code and Makefile so that we don't specify
  any specific standard which should be the most portable, while still
  retaining -Werror to catch unexpected warnings.

Release notes for xtor (formerly midiedit) 1.4

- Blofeld V1.22 now calls itself 'Blofeld' rather than 'Waldorf Blofeld' via
  USB MIDI, so changed default synth device name accordingly.
- Implement external controller infrastructure, using automapping concept so
  that controller numbers for the controller do not have to be set up
  explicitly.
  - Conceptually a controller is a device with (at least) 8 knobs and 8 sets of
    two buttons (inc/dec), or alternatively, two rows of 8 knobs.
    The knobs output increment/decrement signal when turned, and the buttons
    state change signals. There is also provision for a 'focused' control,
    which always controlls the currently focused widget.
    Optionally, a controller may also have four rows of 8 buttons intended as
    hotkeys for jumping between modules and pages.
    If the controller does not have the required number of rows of buttons,
    then a controller-specific shift or prefix key scheme can be implemented.
  - Support for Novation Nocturn, but only via a conversion program so that
    midiedit gets MIDI rather than USB data.
  - Support for Arturia Beatstep. Automatically configures the Beatstep
    with appropriate sysex strings when starting up.
  - Jump feature using external controller, so that midiedit can be navigated
    through pages and modules (frames) using the external controller.
    - For the Nocturn, any of the top row buttons functions as a shift key for
      controller rows 1-2, and any of the bottom row buttons for rows 3-4.
    - For the Beatstep, the pads function as jump button rows 1-2, and
      the SHIFT key works as a prefix key for accessing rows 3-4.
  - Controller name given as command line parameter to midiedit.
- 'Starred' function; pressing * memorizes the current widget, pressing the
  space bar at a later time toggles the focus between the currently focused
  widget and the earlier memorized one.
- Holding CTRL while changing values using keys or scroll wheel causes the
  starred widget to be changed in tandem.
- Restructured Blofeld Sound page so that no module is more than 8 widgets
  wide, to make it fit with the "8 knob wide" controller concept.
  This means that Osc Mix and Filter Pan now have their own frames (and the
  Sound page has been rearranged somewhat).
  - Some modules cannot practically be split. This includes the modulation
    matrix and the effects units. For modules with more than 8 sliders,
    if the controller in fact has more than 8 knobs, all knobs are allocated
    to the sliders, as it would seem that would be the best use of them.
    Conversely, if a module has no sliders, but more than 16 combo boxes
    (i.e. the arpeggiator User Pattern), all knobs are mapped to the combo
    boxes instead.
- Various minor cleanups and bug fixes in the Blofeld UI file.
- Part of the development was carried out under Debian Wheezy, whose glade
  application cannot handle the old .glade file version used in Midiedit.
  The .glade files have therefore been edited on a purely textual basis.
  The plan is to migrate to a newer Glade version (Glade 3) once version 1.4
  has been released.

Release notes for midiedit 1.3

- Restructured Sound page so that oscillator level/balance is in the osc
  boxes, rather than in separate mixer boxes, so the controls line up
  with the oscillators.
- Fix get buffer when selecting part number with keys. Need to press 
  ENTER in order to cause the part to be fetched though.
- Minor cosmetic cleanups in the code.

Release notes for midiedit 1.2

- Fixed osc Limit WT and Osc Sync: parameter numbers were mixed up.
- Fixed step range and increment for Arp Tempo parameter.
- Fixed inverted ranges scrolling wrong way.
- Fixed part order in UI.
- Fixed uninstall target so it properly handles case of partial or missing
  previous installation.
- Remove cyclic key maps (i.e. pressing o repeatedly to cycle between oscs).
- Restructured Osc boxes in UI to use tables instead of v/hboxes.
- Cleaned up function headers and added function comments.
- Minor clode cleanup, and removed all TODOs in code.
